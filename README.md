# Calculator

This is my first application which I used as a way to get familiar with WPF and MVVM structure.
Calculator is inspired from calculator which is built into Windows.

This application will contain multiple calculators:
- __Standart calculator__ - Basic calculator which can read longer mathematical expressions and supports functions such as `sqrt` etc.
- __Body Mass Index calculator__ - Calculator which calculates BMI based on height and weight.

Elements listed below are not completed yet

- __Currency Calculator__ - Calculator for converting various currencies
- __Unit converter__ - Calculator for converting measurement units
- __Date calculator__ - Calculates difference between dates
